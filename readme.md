Aim : 
    Aim of this project is to create a Path Finder which is reusable in nature and easy to work with and having user friendly interface. From last two years, we are
    in the world of covid-19 and every thing is going online, So I decided to create a project which will help to find a most suitable path from one location to the
    another location.




Objective : 
    Will provides different options to perform the different tasks e.g. shortest path, all paths, nearest petrol pump,etcâ€¦
    User will be provided the path ,just after the end of the program...
    All the operations are maintained by the computer program which provides the low error percentage in different tasks.

Conclusion : 
    The visulization of different paths and computerised program utilization combined with statistical data can be used to define the different locations & different       destinations in them. The different locations can be modified with time. There is the possibility of the improvement of in the code in future. Its is a server         friendly implementation . it will provide the efficiency and beneficiary results to the users & enhance automation.
